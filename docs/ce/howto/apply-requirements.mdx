title: "Apply Requirements"
---

Digger currently does not support `apply_requirements` (like in Atlantis). Coming soon - ([#1252](https://github.com/diggerhq/digger/issues/1252))

## Workaround

You can use mergeability requirements together with Status Checks to achieve the same.
Digger will not apply if the pull request is not in a “mergeable” state as specified by GitHub api. This means that if you have a separate status check and you have this check as “required” by branch protection rules then an attempt of digger apply will not go ahead.

Note: there is a [known issue](https://github.com/diggerhq/digger/issues/1180) that would
 cause the "mergability" check to conflict if you set the digger/apply check as required on github. We are working on a fix and in the meantime you have an option to turn off the mergability check if you want to have this digger/apply check as required. You can turn it off in the workflow configuration
  by setting the `skip_merge_check` flag as follows (we have to set the other configurations since they are currently required):

```
projects:
- name: dev
  dir: dev
  workflow: mydev

workflows:
  mydev:
    workflow_configuration:
      on_pull_request_pushed: ["digger plan"]
      on_pull_request_closed: ["digger unlock"]
      on_commit_to_default: ["digger unlock"]
      skip_merge_check: true
```
