title: "Draft PRs"

By default, Digger ignores Draft pull requests. You can enable support of draft PRs by setting `allow_draft_prs` flag in digger.yml:

```
  allow_draft_prs: true
```

## Unlocking on changing back to draft

When a PR changes status from "ready to review" back to "draft":

- if `allow_draft_prs` is `false`, digger will release the lock
- if `allow_draft_prs` is `true`, digger will not do anything (because it's considered a PR like any other)
