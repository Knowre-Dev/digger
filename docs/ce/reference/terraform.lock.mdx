title: "handling terraform.lock file"
---

The `.terraform.lock.hcl` file is an important part of Terraform's dependency management system.
Digger does not currently take opinions on how you manage .terraform.lock files however please be aware that since digger runs terraform
 within ephemeral jobs that if terraform.lock file gets updated within a job its not going to be commited back to the PR.
 Having said that, digger does not pass any `-upgrade` flag during init flag currently. Therefore it is recommended that you use semantic versions
 in your terraform providers and commit .terraform.local file manually. Then when updating versions of providers you can run another `terraform init -upgrade` file to update the file again,
 then commit it to the PR where you are upgrading provider versions.

 Here are some general best practices for working with this file:

## Core Best Practices

1. **Always commit to version control** - The lock file should be committed to your version control system (Git, etc.) to ensure all team members and CI/CD pipelines use exactly the same provider versions.

2. **Don't edit manually** - The lock file is generated and maintained by Terraform. Manual edits can break the hashing verification system.

3. **Use in CI/CD pipelines** - Ensure your automation uses the lock file by not running `terraform init -upgrade` in pipelines.

4. **Update deliberately** - Use `terraform init -upgrade` when you intentionally want to update providers, not as part of regular workflows.

## Additional Recommendations

5. **Review changes** - When the lock file changes after an upgrade, review the differences to understand what provider versions have changed.

6. **Test after updates** - After updating provider versions, thoroughly test your infrastructure code to catch any breaking changes.

7. **Use provider constraints** - In your Terraform configuration, specify version constraints for providers to control which versions can be selected during upgrades.

8. **Understand cross-platform hashes** - The lock file contains hashes for different platforms. If your team uses multiple platforms, you may need to run `terraform providers lock` with the `-platform` flag to add hashes for other platforms.
